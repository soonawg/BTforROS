# TurtleBot3 Behavior Tree with py_trees

This repository contains a behavior tree implementation for TurtleBot3 using `py_trees`. The behavior tree is designed to control the robot's movement and avoid obstacles autonomously.

## Features
- Uses `py_trees` to structure robot behaviors.
- Implements an obstacle avoidance strategy.
- Provides a modular and extendable framework for behavior-based robotics.


## Future Work
- Add more complex behaviors (e.g., path planning, goal navigation).
- Improve obstacle detection using sensor fusion.
